# openSUSE Tumbleweed Configurations

The goal of this project is to configure a fresh install of my Linux setup as
fast as possible. Scripts can be run individually or all together via
`run/setup.sh`. My dotfiles are pulled from a separate repository hosted
[here](https://github.com/yuzhoumo/dotfiles). These scripts were designed with
idempotency in mind and can be re-run periodically.
