# openSUSE Tumbleweed Configurations

The goal of this project is to configure a fresh install of my openSUSE setup
as fast as possible. Scripts can be run individually or all together using
`run/auto.sh`. My dotfiles are pulled from a separate repository hosted
[here](https://github.com/yuzhoumo/dotfiles). These scripts were designed with
idempotency in mind and can be re-run periodically.
